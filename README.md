# PHP-explorer
ðŸ§ª PHP-Explorer is my personal lab for testing PHP features, patterns, and ideas. Just playing, learning, and breaking things for fun! 

 PHP-Explorer is my personal playground for experimenting with PHP features, concepts, and best practices.
 From language features to design patterns and quirky edge cases â€” everything goes!
 Whether it's trying out typed properties, playing with enums, or exploring the depths of PHP, this repo is where I break (and fix) things.
 Just learning, testing, and having fun with PHP â€” no pressure, just code!
