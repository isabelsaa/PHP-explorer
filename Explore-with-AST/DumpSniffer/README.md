## Explore with AST üîç

## Main requirements
PHP version 8.3

In this sub-project I'm experimenting with the php-ast extension, 
which allows me to analyze PHP code by working in its abstract syntax tree (AST).
To get it working properly we need the php-ast:

```
git clone https://github.com/nikic/php-ast.git
cd php-ast
phpize
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
Enable de extension in your php.ini
```extension=ast.so```

Remember you can confirm it checking like this and seeing that the output is "ast":
```php -m | grep ast```

## Usage
To analyse a PHP file:
```php bin/DumpSniffer.php path/to/file.php```

## Running tests
Run the test suite with:
```./vendor/bin/pest .```

Remember ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an experimental tool and it is under development.
